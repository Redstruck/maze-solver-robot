<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Arduino Maze Solver Robot][product-screenshot]](docs/algorithm.md)

> **Interested in how the robot makes decisions?** See the [Algorithm Documentation](docs/algorithm.md) to learn how the maze-solving logic works.

The Arduino Maze Solver Robot is an autonomous robot built to navigate mazes without any human control. Using distance sensors, it detects walls and open paths, processes that information on an Arduino microcontroller, and decides where to move in real time based on a maze-solving algorithm.

Developed during the **UCI ICS Intelligent Robotics Summer Academy**, this project competed in the final maze competition and achieved **1st Place**.

## My Role

I was primarily responsible for the robot’s software and navigation system. I initially built `src/maze_solver_standard` as our baseline maze-solving program, which gave the robot a reliable way to navigate the course. From there, I took it further by developing `src/maze_solver_optimized`, where I focused on making the robot faster and more reliable.

Throughout development, I wrote essentially all of the robot’s navigation and decision-making code and worked through a number of problems that came up during testing. I fixed sensor-reading issues, dealt with the Arduino crashing during operation, improved the robot’s movement and turning behavior, and added stuck detection so the robot could recognize when it was no longer making progress. I repeatedly tested the robot, analyzed what was going wrong, and adjusted the algorithm based on those results.

At the end of the project, I presented the software, algorithm, and optimization process as part of our capstone presentation before demonstrating the finished robot by running it through the maze.

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How It Works

At each step, the robot collects distance readings from its sensors to identify nearby walls and available paths. The Arduino processes this sensor data and uses the decision-making routine to choose the next action, such as moving forward, turning, reversing, or stopping. This process repeats continuously while the robot navigates, allowing it to adjust to the maze in real time without needing a pre-built map of the layout.

> **Interested in how the robot makes decisions?** See the [Algorithm Documentation](docs/algorithm.md) to learn more about the solving logic and decision-making process.

Two versions of the solving logic are included in the repo, tuned differently for reliability versus speed (see [Usage](#usage)).
